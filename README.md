# Voting System

This readme provides an overview of a versatile voting system implemented using PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL, MongoDB, and Python. The system facilitates the creation of questions, submission of answers, and participation in the voting process. It ensures data security, scalability, and offers a visual representation of voting outcomes.

## Features

### User Registration and Authentication

- Users can securely register and authenticate to access the voting system.
- Robust user authentication mechanisms are in place to safeguard system integrity.

### Question Creation

- Registered users can create questions, providing titles and descriptions.
- Questions can incorporate multiple-choice options or allow for custom answers.

### Answer Submission

- Users have the ability to submit answers to questions posed by other users.
- Both predefined options and custom responses are supported.

### Voting Mechanism

- Users can cast votes for their preferred answers, contributing to the decision-making process.
- To ensure fairness, each user is allowed a single vote per question.

### Data Storage

- Data is stored in SQL and MongoDB databases, offering flexibility and scalability.
- SQL databases manage user information, questions, answers, and voting details.
- MongoDB may store additional data or facilitate complex queries.

### Key-based Access

- Secure access is ensured through unique keys associated with user accounts.
- Unauthorized participation in the voting process is prevented.

### Display Module (Python)

- A Python-based display module is integrated to visualize voting results effectively.
- Python libraries like matplotlib or seaborn can generate graphical representations based on stored voting data.

## System Requirements

To run the voting system, ensure that the following components are installed:

- PHP 7.0 or above
- HTML
- CSS
- SQL database (e.g., MySQL)
- MongoDB
- Python 3.x with necessary dependencies (matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)
